## Installation

### Couchbase Setup {#couchbase_setup}

You will need to install Couchbase Server separately. Your Couchbase
cluster can be a single node, or multiple nodes. The nodes can be
installed along side your web servers, or on a server farm of their
own\-- it\'s entirely up to you. The recommended setup would be to have
at least **3** dedicated machines (even if virtual) with several Gigs of
RAM availble to Couchbase.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-info">
```
3 Couchbase servers is the minimum required for auto-failover to work
when employing a single replica configuration. You will need to
determine the durability needs of your Couchbase setup or you can
contact us at <consulting@ortussolutions.com> so we can help you build
your Couchbase Farm.

```{=html}
</div>
```
### Lucee Setup {#lucee_setup}

The Couchbase extension is installed as a Lucee extension into any Lucee
Server version
`<span class="label label-warning">`{=html}4.1.0.001`</span>`{=html} and
above. The extension can either be installed in the server context or a
specific web context.

#### Server Context {#server_context}

`<img src="includes/shots/server_admin.png" class="img-thumbnail" />`{=html}\
\
If installed in the server context, you can create server-level caches
tha are available to all web contexts in Lucee. The driver will also be
availble to all web contexts to add their own local caches or override
caches if they need to.

#### Web Context {#web_context}

`<img src="includes/shots/web_admin.png" class="img-thumbnail" />`{=html}\
\
If the extension is installed in a specific web context, the Couchbase
drivers will be available only to that context and not usable by any
other web context on the server. Any other web contexts that want to use
Couchbase would need to specifically install the extension as well. Be
carefull installing multiple versions of the same extension in a single
JVM as you can get overlapping versions of the same JAR files.

#### Recommended Setup {#recommended_setup}

The recommended setup is to install the extension at the **server**
level. If you have a cache that all contexts will share like session
storage, you could create a cache in each web context that points to the
same Couchbase bucket, but it is recommended to create that cache once
at the server level and let all sites inherit it.

If you have a cache that is only going to be used for one site, it is
recommended you create that cache in the web context for that site only.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-danger">
```
**Important**: You can create multiple named Lucee caches that point to
the same Couchbase bucket. To reduce confusion, try not to do this
unless you have a good reason. A reason could be that you want one
application to have a different operation timeouts.

```{=html}
</div>
```
#### Add Extension Provider {#add_extension_provider}

In your Lucee Administrator under **Extension \> Providers** paste in
your Ortus provider URL
(http://lucee.ortussolutions.com/ExtensionProvider.cfc) and click
**save**.

```{=html}
<div class="well well-small text-center">
```
`<img src="includes/shots/add_provider.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>`{=html}

#### Installing the Extension {#installing_the_extension}

Now click **Extensions \> Applications** and wait for the list to load.
There should be two new items in the list called **Ortus Couchbase
Cache** and **Ortus Couchbase Cache-trial**. You will be installing the
non-trial version since you have purchased the extension.

```{=html}
<div class="well well-small text-center">

#### Activating the Extension {#activating_the_extension}

You will now see our activation screen where you will have to enter the
**license key** and **license email** with which you purchased the
extension with. You will also have to determine the type of server you
are installing the extension to. Development or non-public facing
servers are FREE of charge and by default receive up to 4 activations.
Production servers get only 1 activation, so make sure you choose the
right server type. Once you get all your information in the form then
click on the **install** button to finalize the installation.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-info">
```
**Note** : Development and staging servers are FREE of charge and each
license includes up to 4 activations. Production licenses are on a per
Lucee instance and are allowed 1 activation. If you have any activation
issues please contact us at <support@ortussolutions.com>. Also, make
sure you havea valid internet connection in order to activate your
product.

```{=html}
</div>

```
`<img src="includes/shots/extension_activation.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>`{=html}

Extension Activation

```{=html}
</div>
```
The Ortus Lucee Couchbase Extension should now be installed on your
server and ready to use. We highly recommend you restart your entire
servlet container (Tomcat/Resin/jetty/etc) in order for all Jar files to
take effect. Make sure your Couchbase cluster is running and proceed on
to the next step\-- creating a cache.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-danger">
```
`<strong>`{=html}Important`</strong>`{=html}: Please note that the
Couchbase Extension is licensed on a per-JVM basis. You will need a
license for each separate JVM, regardless of how many contexts (sites)
are deployed in your Lucee installation. The typical setup is one JVM
per physical/virtual server. Please [ask
us](mailto:consulting@ortussolutions.com) if you have licensing
questions.

```{=html}
</div>
```
## Configuration

If you install the Extension in the Server Administrator, you will be
able to create server-level caches as well as site-specific caches in
each of the Web Administrators. If you install the extension in a web
administrator, you will only be able to create Couchbase caches for that
site. We recommend installing the extension in the Server Administrator
so it is available to all the websites under that same Lucee
installation.

To add a new cache, click on **Services \> Cache** and you should see a
list of existing caches. If there are no existing caches, you should be
taken straight to the **create** screen. Type a *name* for this cache
connection and choose **Couchbase Server** from the **type** dropdown
and click **create**.

```{=html}
<div class="well well-small text-center">
```
`<img src="includes/shots/new_cache.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>`{=html}

Create a new cache

```{=html}
</div>
```
You will then be taken to a page of options for the Couchbase Cache
implementation. Check the **Storage** box if you want to be able to use
this cache for session or client storage distribution. Enter the
Couchbase server IP addresses or host names in the text area one per
line. If you have many servers in your Couchbase cluster, you only need
to list a few of them here. The client library will do auto discovery of
the rest of the nodes once it connects. Enter your bucket name and
password.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-info">
```
**Important**: If you are using the default bucket, there will be no
password required.

```{=html}
</div>
```
The **Default** dropdown allows you to specify this connection to be
used as the default storage mechanism for function, object, template,
query, or resource caches in Lucee. If you set this at the server level,
it can be overridden at the website level. Click **Submit** to finish
creating the cache connection and save its settings.

```{=html}
<div class="well well-small text-center">
```
`<img src="includes/shots/cache_settings.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>`{=html}

Cache settings

```{=html}
</div>
```
Here\'s an overview of all the settings available to you on a
cache-by-cache basis:

  **Setting**                          **Type**    **Default**      **Description**
  ------------------------------------ ----------- ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Storage**                          yes/no      no               Allow to use this cache as client/session storage.
  **CouchbaseÂ ServerÂ Hosts**           Text area   localhost:8091   Couchbase server host and port. Put each server and port on a new line.
  **CouchbaseÂ vBucketÂ Name**           Text        default          Couchbase vBucket to connect to.
  **BucketÂ password**                  Text        \-\--            Password for this bucket. Blank if using \"default\" bucket.
  **OperationÂ QueueÂ MaxÂ BlockÂ Time**   Text        10000            The maximum time to block waiting for op queue operations to complete, in milliseconds.
  **OperationÂ Timeout**                Text        2500             Time in millisecs for an operation to Timeout.
  **TimeoutÂ ExceptionÂ Threshold**      Text        998              Number of operations to timeout before the node is deemed down.
  **Default**                          Dropdown    \-\--            Define the default cache connection for Function, Object, Template, Query, or Resource caches.

## Usage

There are a number of ways that the extension integrates Couchbase into
your Lucee server. There is built-in caching, manual get/set of objects,
and scope storage.

### CFML

The first and easiest way to use your new cache is via the built-in
cache functions and tags in CFML. You can specify the cache name to use,
but by default Lucee will use the cache you have designated as your
default **object** cache.

#### Caching Objects {#caching_objects}

If you have selected your cache as the default **Object** cache in the
admin, you can simply use functions like `cachePut()` and `cacheGet()`.
Couchbase can handle arbitrary snippets of text (like HTML snippets) and
even complex objects such as queries, arrays, or structs. The cache will
automatically serialize the values and store them as text. They will be
reconstituted when you retreive them from the cache later.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-info">
```
**Important**: A single cache item can be up to 20 MB in size!

```{=html}
</div>
```
If you pass in complex objects to `cachePut()`, they will be serialized
as binary and not usable in Couchbase views.

``` {.javascript}
// Set a simple value into the default "object" cache for 2 days
cachePut( "key", "value", 2 );
// Get that value back
cacheGet( "key" );

// Set a value into a specific cache for 1 day
cachePut( "key", "value", 1, "myCacheName" );
// Get that value back
cacheGet( "key", "myCacheName" );

// Cache this array for 3 hours
cachePut( "myArray", [1,2,3,4,5], createTimeSpan(0,3,0,0) );
```

#### Caching Function Output {#caching_function_output}

Once you have selected a cache as the default **function** cache in the
admin, you can use Couchbase to cache the results of oft-run functions.
The cache key will be created for you automatically based on a hash of
the method arguments thanks to Lucee. Cached functions should therefore
be deterministic\-- meaning the output of the function is purely a
product of its parameters. Using function caching is easy, just add a
`cachedwithin` attribute to the `cffunction` tag or function
declaration.

``` {.coldfusion}
<!--- Cache results of this function for 5 minutes --->
<cffunction name="myFunc" cachedwithin="#createTimeSpan(0,0,5,0)#">
    <cfargument name="inputText">
    
    <cfreturn reverse(inputText)>
</cffunction>

<!--- First execution stores result in cache --->
<cfset result = myFunc("Brad Wood")>

<!--- subsequent call skips execution and pulls results from cache --->
<cfset result = myFunc("Brad Wood")>

<!--- Different parameters will create a new cache entry --->
<cfset result = myFunc("Luis Majano")>
```

This is what that function would look like in script

``` {.javascript}
function myFunc( inputText ) cachedwithin="#createTimeSpan(0,0,5,0)#" {
    return reverse(inputText);
}
```

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-danger">
```
`<strong>`{=html}Important`</strong>`{=html}: Lucee only supports
caching functions that accept simple values as paramters. Therefore, a
function that accepts an array would not be cacheable.

```{=html}
</div>
```
#### Caching Queries {#caching_queries}

Once you have selected a cache as the default **query** cache in the
admin, you can use Couchbase to cache the results of oft-run database
queries. The cache key will be created for you automatically based on a
hash of the SQL statement and its parameters thanks to Lucee. Using
query caching is as easy as function caching, just add a

    cachedwithin

attribute to your query.

``` {.coldfusion}
<!--- Cache results of this query for 15 minutes --->
<cfquery datasource="datasourceName" name="qryTest" cachedwithin="#createTimeSpan(0,0,15,0)#">
    select *
    from [tableName]
</cfquery>
```

#### Lucee RAM Resources {#lucee_ram_resources}

Lucee has the concept and feature of virtual file systems. Our extension
taps into it by allowing you to leverage the `ram://` resource to talk
to Couchbase for storing documents and treating Couchbase like a big
file system. This means that any **file** or **directory** related
tag/function can work with Couchbase RAM resource like:
`fileRead(), fileWrite(), fileDelete(), directoryNew(), directoryList(), include`,
etc. It even works when defining application mappings. You can define
Couchbase to be the default cache for **resources** by selecting the
**default** element in the cache details page and pointing it to
**resource**.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-danger">
```
**Important**: Please note that Lucee only allows you to determine 1
cache connection to be the default for either object, template, query,
resource or function caching. So you might end up creating different
cache connections if you want to leverage them as default cache
locations.

```{=html}
</div>
```
Once you setup Couchbase to be your default **resource** cache you can
leverage it in many ways:

``` {.coldfusion}
// Create a mapping to it
this.mappings[ "/cluster-fs" ] = "ram://";


// Do some file operations
fileWrite( "/cluster-fs/suzi.txt", myContent );
include template="/cluster-fs/aop.cfm";
directoryList( "/cluster-fs/caches" );
```

#### Working With JSON Documents {#working_with_json_documents}

Couchbase is more than a simple key/value store though; it is also a
NoSQL document store. If you pass in a string that can be parsed as
JSON, will be treated specially and indexed as JSON inside Couchbase.
You will be able to create views in Couchbase that reference specific
keys in your JSON document if you wish. We have created some methods to
help you interact with Couhbase as a document store. However, we do
recommend that you use our [CFCouchbase Companion
SDK](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/cfcouchbase) for all your
NoSQL needs.

##### **couchbaseSet**

  **Parameter**                 **Required**   **Type**   **Default**   **Description**
  ----------------------------- -------------- ---------- ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **id**                        Yes            string     \-\--         This is the ID of the document to set.
  **value**                     Yes            any        \-\--         The value to be stored. If the value is complex, it will be serialized as JSON. If JSON serialization is not possible, it will be stored as binary.
  **serializeQueryByColumns**   No             boolean    false         This flag is used to control how queries are serialized. See docs for serializeJSON().
  **cacheName**                 No             string     \-\--         Specify the name of the Lucee cache for the delete operation to be exeucted on. If none is specified, the Lucee default Object cache is used.

``` {.javascript}
// Set an array
CouchbaseSet( "myArray", ['a','b','c','d','e'] );

// Set a struct
CouchbaseSet( "myStruct", {"foo":"bar","loo":5,"subStruct":{"goo":"smar"},"subArray":[1,2,3,4,5]}, "cacheName" );
```

##### **couchbaseGet**

  **Parameter**           **Required**   **Type**   **Default**   **Description**
  ----------------------- -------------- ---------- ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **id**                  Yes            string     \-\--         This is the ID of the document to set.
  **throwWhenNotExist**   No             boolean    No            Set this to true to throw an error if the ID being retrieved doesn\'t exist. Default is false. If false, null will be returned.
  **cacheName**           No             string     \-\--         Specify the name of the Lucee cache for the delete operation to be exeucted on. If none is specified, the Lucee default Object cache is used.

``` {.javascript}
CouchbaseGet( "myArray" );

CouchbaseGet( "myStruct", "cacheName" );
```

##### **couchbaseDelete**

  **Parameter**      **Required**   **Type**   **Default**   **Description**
  ------------------ -------------- ---------- ------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **id**             Yes            string     \-\--         This is the ID of the document to set.
  **throwOnError**   No             boolean    No            Set this to true to throw an error if the ID being deleted doesn\'t exist. Default is false.
  **cacheName**      No             string     \-\--         Specify the name of the Lucee cache for the delete operation to be exeucted on. If none is specified, the Lucee default Object cache is used.

``` {.javascript}
CouchbaseDelete( "myArray" );

CouchbaseDelete( "myStruct", "cacheName" );
```

#### Executing Couchbase Queries {#executing_couchbase_queries}

Let\'s pretend we have a bucket in Couchbase called \"employee\" where
we stored a number of documents representing the workers at our company.
In the Couchbase admin we can create an indexed view that returns
employee name as the key. We won\'t go into how to create views here.
You can read about it in the [Couchbase
docs](http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-views-editor-createedit.html).

Let\'s assume our view that returns employees by name is called
\"employeeName\" and exists in a design document called
\"employee_views\". We can execute that view directly from our CFML code
with a special built-in function (BIF) that the extension registers with
Lucee.

``` {.javascript}
// Return all employees, sorted by name.
results = couchbaseQueryView("employee_views", "employeeName");

// Return all employees named "Brad" and include the full JSON document
results = couchbaseQueryView(designDocument="employee_views", viewName="employeeName", key="Brad", includeDoc=true);
```

By default this function will return an array of structs representing
the id, key, and value of matching items in the view. There are optional
parameters to return the entire document for each matching result as
well as return the native Java objects for you to interate over. Here\'s
a rundown of the parameters the couchbaseQueryView accepts.

#### Per-application Cache Settings {#per_application_cache_settings}

You can speicify what caches are the default storage mechanism for
functions, queries, objects, etc in the Lucee server and web
administrator. There is one more programmatic level this can be
configured as well.

The following settings are available in your Application.cfc to override
at an application level. Remember, the \"object\" cache is used by
default if no cache name is specified to functions such as cachePut(),
cacheGet(), couchbaseSet(), and couchbaseGet().

``` {.javascript}
component{
    this.cache.function="<cache-name>";
    this.cache.query="<cache-name>";
    this.cache.object="<cache-name>";
    this.cache.resource="<cache-name>";
    this.cache.template="<cache-name>";
}
```

### Scope storage {#scope_storage}

Lucee will allow you to seamlessly defer storage of your session and/or
client scopes to Couchbase. You will set and access the scopes like you
normally would in CFML, but behind the scenes Lucee stores a cache entry
for each user containing their session/client variables in the Couchbase
cluster. This serves several purposes:

-   Scopes are persisted across server restarts
-   Lower memory usage since variables are NOT stored in the JVM\'s heap
-   User sessions can be shared across web servers (No more sticky
    sessions)
-   Couchbase cluster can be scaled out to handle whatever amount of
    users you need in a distributed fashion

This means you could take your single-server application with a heavy
dependence on session/client variables, and scale it out to as many web
servers as neccessary behind a round-robin load balancer. Users are free
to roam to any web server they want, and their session variables will
follow them anywhere with no extra ovearhead.

Or perhaps you have Millions of web site visitors and you\'re running
out of heap space due to all the session storage. Push those sessions
off to a distributed Couchbase layer that can scale out to meet demand,
and that is no longer a bottleneck.

For both session and client storage, you will need to check the
**Storage** box when creating or editing the cache connection you want
to use in the Lucee admin. Remember you can create multuple buckets in
Couchbase to help manage your documents and segregate RAM.

```{=html}
<div class="well well-small text-center">
```
`<img src="includes/shots/storage.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>`{=html}

Set a cache as usable for session or client storage

```{=html}
</div>
```
#### Session

Once the cache is created, enabling session storage is easy. In your
`<span class="label label-info">`{=html}Application.cfc`</span>`{=html}
simply confirm `sessionManagment` is turned on and set the following two
settings as well in the `this` scope:

-   **sessionStorage**: This is the name of the cache defined in your
    Lucee administrator that you wish to store sessions in
-   **sessionCluster**: This controls how/when session data is sent and
    retrieved from the cache.
    -   **true**: Session data is primarily stored in cache. It is
        always pulled from the cache at the start of each request, and
        backed up at the end. Use this setting if you have multuple
        applications using cached storage and you want the full benifit
        of distributed sessions.
    -   **false**: Session data is primarily stored in memory but backed
        up on every request to the cache. Session data is only pulled
        from the cache if it doesn\'t exist in memory. Set this to false
        if you only have one application using session cache storage and
        you simply want to persist session storage across restarts.

``` {.javascript}
component{
    this.name = "myApp";
        
    this.sessionManagement = true;
    this.sessionTimeout = createTimeSpan(0,0,30,0);
    
    // This is the name of the Couchbase cache to use
    this.sessionStorage = "SessionStorageCache";
    // Set this to true if you have more than 1 application
    this.sessionCluster = true;
}
```

#### Client

Storing your client scope in Couchbase is just as easy as session
storagey. In your
`<span class="label label-info">`{=html}Application.cfc`</span>`{=html}
confirm `clientManagement` is turned on and set the following two
settings in the `this` scope:

-   **clientStorage**: This is the name of the cache defined in your
    Lucee administrator that you wish to store client data in
-   **clientCluster**: This controls how/when client data is sent and
    retrieved from the cache.
    -   **true**: Client data is primarily stored in cache. It is always
        pulled from the cache at the start of each request, and backed
        up at the end. Use this setting if you have multuple
        applications using cached storage and you want the full benifit
        of distributed client data.
    -   **false**: Client data is primarily stored in memory but backed
        up on every request to the cache. Client data is only pulled
        from the cache if it doesn\'t exist in memory. Set this to false
        if you only have one application using client cache storage and
        you simply want to persist client storage across restarts.

``` {.javascript}
component{
    this.name = "myApp";
    
    this.clientManagement = true;
    this.clientTimeout = createTimeSpan(25,0,0,0);
    
    // This is the name of the Couchbase cache to use
    this.clientStorage = "CientStorageCache";
    // Set this to true if you have more than 1 application
    this.clientCluster = true;
    
}
```

### Direct Java API {#direct_java_api}

If you need more power or are familiar with the Couchbase Java API and
want to use some features we haven\'t implemented yet, first [let us
know](mailto:support@ortussolutions.com) so we can consider that
addition in future version, and then head over to the Java Client to get
direct access to the Couchbase Java SDK.

#### Couchbase Java Client {#couchbase_java_client}

The Couchbase extension registers a built-in function (BIF) called
`couchbaseGetClient()` that you can call anywhere in your application to
get a direct reference to the Couchbase Java Client that powers the
Couchbase extension.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-info">
```
Remember, that there is a client instance for each Couchbase cache
defined in the administrator. If you call the `couchbaseGetClient()`
function with no parameters, you will get the client that corresponds
with the default object cache (assuming it is Couchbase). Alternativley,
you can pass in a `cacheName` parameter to specifiy the Couchbase cache
connection.

```{=html}
</div>
```
  **Parameter**   **Required**   **Type**   **Default**   **Description**
  --------------- -------------- ---------- ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **cacheName**   No             string     \-\--         Definition of the cache used by name, when not set the \"default Object Cache\" defined in Lucee Administrator is used instead. An error will be thrown if the cache is not a Couchbase cache or does not exist.

``` {.javascript}
// Get the Java client for the default object cache
myClient = couchbaseGetClient();

// Get the Java client for the queryStorage cache
myClient = couchbaseGetClient("queryStorage");  

// Set object directly into cache
myClient.set(key, expiry, value);

// get object directly into cache
myClient.get(key);

// Remove object direclty from cache
myClient.delete(key)
```

Don\'t forget to `javaCast()` and realize that you may have issues
trying to use the keys that the Extension has set since you are
bypassing our serialization schema as well.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-info">
```
The Couchbase Java client is fully [documented
here](http://www.couchbase.com/autodocs/couchbase-java-client-1.3.2/index.html).

```{=html}
</div>
```
#### Ortus Couchbase Java Provider {#ortus_couchbase_java_provider}

There is one more BIF that the Couchbase extension will register with
your Lucee installation. It is called `couchbaseGetProvider()` and
returns an instance to the Java class that Ortus wrote that proxies
between the Couchbase client and Lucee. It implements
`lucee.commons.io.cache.Cache` and you can read about its API in the
[Lucee /commons/io/cache/Cache.html Lucee API
docs](http://www.getluceeorg/javadoc-4-0/).

For the most part you probably won\'t need this class, but there are a
few methods in the Lucee cache interface that aren\'t available to you
via CFML.

  **Parameter**   **Required**   **Type**   **Default**   **Description**
  --------------- -------------- ---------- ------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **cacheName**   No             string     \-\--         Definition of the cache used by name, when not set the \"default Object Cache\" defined in Lucee Administrator is used instead. An error will be thrown if the cache is not a Couchbase cache or does not exist.

``` {.javascript}
// Get the Ortus Java Provider for the default object cache
myProvider = couchbaseGetProvider();

// Get the Ortus Java Provider for the queryStorage cache
myProvider = couchbaseGetProvider( "queryStorage" );  

// Get all keys in the cache as a java.util.List 
keys = myProvider.keys();

// Get all the values in the cache as a java.util.List
values = myProvider.values();
```

One important thing to note is that values `get` and `set` by the Ortus
provider will be correctly serialized for you unline direct access to
the Couchbase Java client.

## Debugging/Troubleshooting

Here\'s a general list of troubleshooting steps if you\'re getting
errors. The log files are VERY important since the error Lucee throws
doesn\'t always contain the information you need. You will have to crack
open your Lucee logs to get the actual error out.

-   Look in the \"out\" and \"err\" logs for information. These are
    usually found in the servlet container\'s log directory. For
    instance, if you\'re using Tomcat, look in Tomcat\'s log directory.
    There are often messages logged there that never make it up to the
    CFML engine.
-   Always scroll to the bottom of Java stack traces to look for a
    \"caused by\" section which is the original error.
-   If you\'re getting class not found errors, double check the jar
    files are in the correct directories and that you restarted the JVM.
-   If you are getting connection errors or Null pointer exceptions,
    check the spelling of your hostnames and ports and make sure
    Couchbase is actually running with the bucket name you specified in
    the config.
-   Make sure there\'s no conflicting versions of either of your jar
    files laying around on your hard drive that could also be in the
    classpath and interfering. This could include old versions of the
    Extension or Membase/CouchDB extensions which share some of the same
    jars.
-   Once the library connects, you should see lines in the \"out\" log
    showing the servers being connected to successfully.
-   Open up the Couchbase web admin on one of your nodes and watch the
    \"Ops per second\" graph while you hit your app. If you see spikes
    in the graph every time you hit the app, then it\'s working!
